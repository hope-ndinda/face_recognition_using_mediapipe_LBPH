# Face Recognition using MediaPipe + LBPH  

This project performs real-time face recognition using **MediaPipe for detection** and **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram)** for classical recognition — no modern deep learning required.

The system is trained on images captured from a webcam for two subjects:

| Label | Person Name |
|-------|-------------|
| 0     | Hope        |
| 1     | Jolie       |

## 🚀 Features

✔ Detect faces in real-time using MediaPipe  
✔ Train a classical LBPH recognition model  
✔ Recognize **Hope** & **Benite** live from webcam  
✔ Works without deep learning — pure feature-based AI
